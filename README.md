#Handling Anomalies in Intrusion Detection using Machine Learning
Intrusion detection is an important aspect of network security to identify any unauthorized access to computer systems. Machine learning algorithms can be used to identify these anomalies and improve the accuracy of intrusion detection. This repository provides a demonstration of handling anomalies in intrusion detection using three machine learning algorithms: Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Classifier (SVC), and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and three datasets: KDD99, NSL-KDD, and UNSW-NB15.

# Requirements
Python 3.x
NumPy
Pandas
Matplotlib
Scikit-learn
Imbalanced-learn
# Datasets
## KDD99: This dataset is widely used for intrusion detection research and it has been preprocessed for ease of use.
## NSL-KDD: This dataset is an improvement over the KDD99 dataset, addressing some of its limitations.
## UNSW-NB15: This dataset is designed to reflect real-world scenarios and contains a mix of normal and abnormal network traffic.
#Machine Learning Algorithms
Random Forest (RF): RF is an ensemble learning method for classification, regression, and other tasks that operate by constructing a multitude of decision trees at training time and outputting the class that is the mode of the classes (classification) or mean prediction (regression) of the individual trees.
Support Vector Classifier (SVC): SVC is a linear model for classification and regression analysis. It is used for finding a hyperplane that best separates the data into different classes.
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN): KNN is a simple algorithm that stores all available cases and classifies new cases based on a similarity measure. The distance can, for example, be Euclidean distance.
